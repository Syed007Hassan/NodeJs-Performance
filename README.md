# NodeJs-Performance

* [Maximizing Cluster Perfromance ](https://github.com/Syed007Hassan/NodeJs-Performance/tree/69dabf9ae8c2f96e53baee4f383aff521882e357):
  Using the amount of logical cores available on a system, increasing the performance of web servers so that the response time can be lesser when multiple requests are being made. A module that is responsible for providing cluster related API is called a cluster. It's NodeJS inbuilt module. Cluster uses single master(parent) process and many worker(child) process.
